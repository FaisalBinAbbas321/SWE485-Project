##  Project Motivation
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.  
Early detection of stroke-related risk factors such as age, blood pressure, glucose level, and BMI can save lives.  
This dataset was selected because it contains **realistic patient health indicators** that can be used to **train a machine-learning model** to predict stroke risk and provide helpful medical advice for early prevention.
